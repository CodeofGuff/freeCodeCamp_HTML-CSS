            <h3>Here is a timeline so far of my journey into coding!</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1 Year Ago</strong> In March of 20203 I began researching bootcamps and other forms of educating myself as a new comer to working with computing languages. 
                I quicky began to see that this world was much larger then I had anticipated and quickly became overwheled with "what do I do first?" 
                After a few weeks of reddit and youtube, the answer was clear that I needed to build from the ground up. Start small/slow and learn with a purpose.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Present Day</strong> As of March 1st 2024 I officially began my journey into the computing world. 
                    After some personal time/voice acting/general like stuff, I found the rorutine and mindset to pursue coding. 
                    I am starting with freeCodeCamp HTML/CSS course and wow what an amazing expirence so far! 
                    I have come leaps and bounds in 2 weeks and can't wait to dive into JavaScript and learn all about becoming a fullstack web and app developer
                </li>
            </ul>
